# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** The design doc should already exist at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>/design.md`, committed by the brainstorm skill.

**Save plan to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>/implementation.md` (same directory as the design doc)

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**

- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Agent:** Use the executing-plans skill to implement this plan.

**Design:** See `design.md` in this directory for full context.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**

- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Remember

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## After Saving the Plan

1. Commit the implementation plan to git
2. Offer dispatch:

**"Plan complete and saved. Want me to dispatch an agent to implement it in an isolated worktree?"**

- **If yes:** Invoke the dispatch skill with the plan directory path and feature name
- **If no:** Let the user know they can invoke dispatch manually later

## Integration

**Called by:**

- **brainstorm** — after design is approved and documented

**Invokes:**

- **dispatch** — to create worktree and launch executing agent
